        <h2><b>Kozhikode</b></h2>
        <p>

It was a significant spice trade center and is close to Kappad Beach, where Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed in 1498. The central Kozhikode Beach, overlooked by an old lighthouse, is a popular spot for watching the sunset. Inland, tree-lined Mananchira Square, with its musical fountain, surrounds the massive Mananchira Tank, an artificial pond. Much like Trivandrum, Kozhikode has been a habitat for multiple dynasties which have left their imprint on the city. Perhaps that is why Kozhikode is dubbed as the ‘City of Sculptures’. Kozhikode is also considered as the ‘City of Spices’ as it a major trading port of eastern spices. The district is famous for folk songs or ballads known as Vadakkan Pattukal. The sweet-meat street is a popular tourist hub and is a centre of marketing for many products that are locally produced in the region.
