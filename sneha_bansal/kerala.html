Inland, tree-lined Mananchira Square, with its musical fountain, surrounds the massive Mananchira Tank, an artificial pond. Much like Trivandrum, Kozhikode has been a habitat for multiple dynasties which have left their imprint on the city. Perhaps that is why Kozhikode is dubbed as the ‘City of Sculptures’. Kozhikode is also considered as the ‘City of Spices’ as it a major trading port of eastern spices. The district is famous for folk songs or ballads known as Vadakkan Pattukal. The sweet-meat street is a popular tourist hub and is a centre of marketing for many products that are locally produced in the region.
