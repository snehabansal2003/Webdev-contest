        <h2><b>India Gate</b></h2>
        <p>
            This 42 meter high "Arc-de-Triomphe" like archway situated in the heart of Delhi city is much taller in the hearts of India. Formerly known as All India War Memorial, India Gate was built to commemorate the death of 70,000 British Indian soldiers who died during First World War between 1914-21.
Even though the India Gate was constructed as a war memorial, the architectural style of the monument makes it appear like an epitome of triumph. Much similar to Arch of Constantine, outside the Colosseum in Rome, India gate was designed by Sir Edward Lutyens. India Gate got an additional structure in the form of a black marble plinth, with a reversed rifle capped by a soldier’s helmet after the Bangladesh Liberation War.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Red Fort</b></h2>
        <p>
            Red Fort, popularly known as Lal Quila, is the pride of the nation. It is a historic fort, situated in the older part of the city. Lal Quila served as the primary residence for Mughal Emperors who ruled the city, for about 200 years. It was until 1856 that the Mughals had resided in Lal Quila. Besides, the historical monument also served as the political center of the Mughals.
Red Fort was built under the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in the year 1639. It was made on the lines of Shah Jahan's palace in his fortified capital Shahanabad. It was called Red Fort because of its massive closed walls built in red stone. The palace not only showcases the architectural brilliance of Shah Jahan but also gives a reasonably good picture of Islamic architecture of those times.

        <h2><b>Humayun's Tomb</b></h2>
        <p>
            The tomb of Mughal Emperor Humayun, called Humayun’s Tomb, was built in Delhi in 1569-70. The construction of Humayun’s Tomb was commissioned by his first wife and chief consort Empress Bega Begum.
It was designed by Mirak Mirza Ghiyas and his son, Sayyid Muhammad along with some Persian architects, who were chosen by the Begum. Located in Nizamuddin East, Humayun’s Tomb is the first garden tomb of Indian sub-continent. It was declared UNESCO World Heritage SIte in 1993. The complex of Humayun’s Tomb not just houses the tomb of Emperor Humayun, but also the graves of Bega Begum, Hamida Begum, Dara Shikoh, grandson of Emperor Humayun, son of Emperor Shah Jahan.

        <h2><b>Qutub Minar</b></h2>
        <p>
            Qutab Minar, Qutb Minar or Qutub Mina spell it as it suits you. Spelling could defer from historian to historian, but the charm of the building remained the same throughout the history. This 73-meter tall minaret has five stories. Interestingly, the base diameter of the structure is 14.3 meters, while it slims down to 2.7 meters as it approaches the top.
            Qutub Minar draws inspiration from Minaret of jam, built in Afghanistan. It is believed that Qutab Ud-din Aibak, the founder of Delhi Sultanate, started building the minaret around 1192. He is credited to have built the first floor of the five-storeyed minaret. However, the task was taken up by Aibak’s son-in-law and successor, Iltutmish, who has added three more stories to the minaret in the year 1220.
        </p>
       
        <h2><b>Lotus Temple</b></h2>
        <p>
            Lotus Temple is one of the most prominent attractions of Delhi. Known for its Lotus flower-like shape, the place is a Baha’i House of Worship. Opened for the public in December 1986, construction of The Lotus Temple cost around $10 million. The temple is not just known for its scenic value. It is the serenity and calm of Lotus Temple that attracts people from across the globe.
            The best part of this temple is that people from any religion, caste or creed can visit it, without any inhibition or boundation. However, it remains a significant attraction amongst the tourists purely from the architectural point of view.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Akshardham Temple</b></h2>
        <p>
            Swaminarayan Akshardham Temple, also known as Akshardham, is one of the most important social, religious and cultural places of Delhi. BAPS has constructed the temple. It is inspired by Yogiji Maharaj and is created by Pramukh Swami Maharaj.

Akshardham Temple, Delhi, is the successor of Akshardham Temple, Gandhinagar, Gujarat and is built according to Vastu Shastra and Panchatantra Shastra.
The main shrine of the temple is the central point and is the main attraction of the temple. There are various exhibition halls created in the complex that displays an excellent sense of design and technology.
