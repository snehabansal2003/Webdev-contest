        <h2><b>Udaipur City Palace</b></h2>
        <p>
            The City Palace, located on the banks of Lake Pichola, will give you a glimpse into Rajasthan’s princely grandeur with its towering structures built for the erstwhile Mewar ruling family. The palace will wow travelers with its exquisite interiors consisting detailed mirror-work, unique paintings, murals, antique furniture and marble work. The palace complex is divided into many beautiful villas and palaces, including Amar Vilas, Bhim Vilas, Krishna Vilas, Manak Mahal and Moti Mahal. The City Palace in Udaipur was built in a flamboyant style and is considered the largest of its type in the state of Rajasthan. It was built atop a hill, in a fusion of the Rajasthani Rajput architecture.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Lake Palace</b></h2>
        <p>
            The iconic Lake Palace will arrest you with its beauty and scenic location on the 4-km long, man-made Lake Pichola. The palace is now operated by the Taj Group and offers captivating views of the Aravalli Hills. This is certainly one of the most romantic locations in the entire state and the heritage walks are to die for! Maharaja Jagat Singh II built this amazing palace that will bowl you over with its sculpted marble and moldings. While here, you can spend all day boating on the placid Lake Pichola, commencing from Rameshwar Ghat to the City Palace. The shooting of the Hollywood James Bond film 'Octopussy' took place in 1983 and that made Lake Palace world famous.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Jagmandir</b></h2>
        <p>
            Another romantic destination in Udaipur, this 17th-century palace complex is also situated on Lake Pichola. Also, known as Lake Garden Palace, Jagmandir will draw you with its sheer splendor and tranquility. It has divisions like the Garden Courtyard, Gul Mahal, Darikhana, Bara Patharon ka Mahal, Kunwar Pada ka Mahal and Zenana Mahal. This is another must-visit during your boat ride. Its construction is credited to three Maharanas of the Sisodia Rajputs of Mewar kingdom.  Also called the 'Lake Garden Palace', the palace was used as the summer resort by the royal family for hosting parties. Interestingly, Prince Khurram - later Emperor Shah Jahan - was given shelter here when he rebelled against his father Emperor Jahangir.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Jagdish Temple</b></h2>
        <p>
            The Indo-Aryan Jagdish Temple owes its creation to the Maharana Jagat Singh. The temples in Udaipur lies near the City Palace’s Badi Pol entry and you have to go up through a few steps. The black stone deity of Lord Vishnu will awe you and so will the brass Garuda image facing it. There are many other shrines dedicated to the Sun God, Lord Ganesha, Lord Shiva and Goddess Shakti. The sunset Aarti will be a wonderful experience here. Jagdish Temple is a large Hindu temple in the middle of Udaipur in Rajasthan, just outside the royal palace. A big tourist attraction, the temple was originally called the temple of Jagannath Rai but is now called Jagdish-ji. It is a major monument in Udaipur.
        </p>
        
        <h2><b>Fateh Sagar Lake</b></h2>
        <p>
            This beautiful man-made lake with its striking blue-hued waters against the backdrop of green hills is what has earned Udaipur its sobriquet of “The Second Kashmir”. Exceptionally clean and expansive, the Fateh Sagar Lake is a great place to visit in Udaipur mainly for its 4 islands that are attractions in themselves. Accessible only by boat, the islands play host to public parks and a solar observatory that is worth a see. The lake in Udaipur, named after Maharana Fateh Singh of Udaipur and Mewar, is a central to the city’s life that not only supplies water to the urban areas but also provides employment to a large fraction of the populace. It is an artificial lake named after Maharana Fateh Singh of Udaipur and Mewar, constructed north-west of Udaipur, to the north of Lake Pichola in the 1680s.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Maharana Pratap Memorial</b></h2>
        <p>
            Right at the top of the Moti Magri, overlooking the Fateh Sagar Lake is a lifelike statue of Udaipur’s most celebrated ruler, Maharana Pratap and his beloved horse Chetak. Visit this imposing memorial to the warrior king and his favorite mount who is believed to have saved his master’s life in the epic battle of Haldighati. A Japanese rock garden and the remnants of an old fort in Udaipur lie nearby and make for an interesting vignette. One of the most thrilling features of the Memorial is a life-sized bronze statue of Maharana Pratap sitting on his faithful horse, Chetak. The figure is 11 feet high and weighs about 70 tonnes. The sculpture can be seen from kilometers away.
