        <div class="text">
        <h2><b>Jantar Mantar</b></h2>
        <p>
            At first glance, Jantar Mantar may look to be nothing more than a bunch of larger-than-life abstract sculptures. But this is not an art gallery–it's a special collection of astronomical tools started by Rajput ruler Jai Singh II to measure the heavens nearly 300 years ago.
Each of the 20 or so structures at the UNESCO World Heritage Site serves a distixnctive purpose. The observatory's massive sun dial, known as Samrat Yantra, is particularly striking. At 27 meters tall, it casts a huge shadow that accurately measures time down to two seconds.
The elaborate Jai Prakash also tracks the passing of time, using the shadow of a metal plate suspended above a sunken bowl-like structure.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Hawa Mahal</b></h2>
        <p>If you had any preconceived notions about how the buildings in Jaipur look, they probably came from Hawa Mahal (Palace of Breeze). It has all of the distinctive architectural features that appear in postcards of the city, from the salmon-pink, honeycombed facade, built to resemble the crown of Hindu god Krishna, to the geometric accents and rows of tiny windows.
            The landmark was built in 1799 to allow royal ladies to watch festivals on the street without being seen by the public. Its 953 windows allow plenty of breeze to pass through, making it an ideal summer palace.
            Tourists can learn about the history of the sandstone structure at the palace's small museum–the ceremonial armor collection is particularly interesting.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Amber Fort</b></h2>
        <p>Jaipur is home to one of India's most-visited forts: Amber Fort. Built in the year 1592, the sandstone and marble monolith stands atop a small hill roughly 20 minute's driving distance northeast of the center of Jaipur. It's best known for being a pristine example of Rajasthani architecture.
            Getting to Amber Fort typically involves a short uphill hike that's well worth the effort. It's decked out with intricate patterns of inlaid marble in nearly every color of the rainbow. The fort is laid out into four separate sections, each of which has a spectacular garden courtyard outside. While you'd never know it from above, you can actually explore the fort's underground tunnels, some of which have been restored.
            This UNESCO World Heritage Site has a fascinating history of legends, betrayals, and romance.
        </p>
        
        <h2><b>Birla Mandir</b></h2>
        <p>
            Birla Mandir, Jaipur is a Hindu temple located in Jaipur, India and is one of many Birla mandirs. It was built by the B.M. Birla Foundation in 1988 and is constructed solely of white marble. In a city that seems to be dipped from top to bottom in pink, the stark white marble Birla Mandir stands out–big time. The Hindu temple pays tribute to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and purity, and Vishnu, one of the religion's main deities.
The marvelous structure exudes a quiet, peaceful vibe, offering just the right atmosphere to appreciate fine marble carvings, shrines to gods, and gorgeous sunset views. While you don't need more than 30 minutes to get a sense of the space, the experience will prove to be a restorative break from a day of sightseeing.
        </p>
       
        <h2><b>Nahargarh Fort</b></h2>
        <p>
            When it comes to sightseeing around Jaipur, the views don't get better than what you'll find at Nahargarh Fort. Also known as Tiger Fort, the nearly 300-year-old fort overlooks the entire city from atop the Aravalli Hills–a prime location for the structure to defend Jaipur against enemies many years ago.
More than just a formidable barrier though, this fort also contains Madhavendra Bhawan, a summer destination for royalty. The sumptuous Rajasthani building features a dozen identical boudoirs for the queens, which all connect to the king's suite through mural-filled corridors.
Tourists can also explore the fort's wax museum and sculpture park. And if you're feeling hungry, swing by one of the fort's many restaurants to tuck into traditional Indian cuisine.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Galta Ji</b></h2>
        <p>
            Sources of water can be few and far between in the desert state of Rajasthan. So it's no wonder that when people discovered a natural spring in a mountain pass in the Aravalli Hills, they honored it by building the Hindu temple Galta Ji. Nestled between cliffs, the temple features a few sacred water tanks, some with modest fountains, as well as frescoes that tell tales about Hindu god Krishna.
            While the official name for this place is Galta Ji, it's better known as the Monkey Temple for the hundreds of macaques and langurs that live here. Daring tourists might opt to buy a handful of peanuts at the gate to tempt the monkeys, but you're better off just watching the rambunctious creatures from a distance.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Jal Mahal</b></h2>
        <p>
            One look at the Jal Mahal, and you might think you're seeing a mirage. The graceful palace seems to float atop the twinkling Man Sagar Lake–a calm sight compared to the rest of the frenzied city.
            While it appears to have just one story, the Water Palace has four other levels submerged beneath a reservoir. Tourists can't access the site, however, that may change in the future. Rumor has it that entrepreneurs want to convert the decaying space into a luxe restaurant.
            For now, simply appreciate the beauty of the palace from afar. At night, it's lit up in all its glory, casting a golden, glowing reflection on the water. This is one the best places to visit in Jaipur specially in evening time.
        </p>
        <h2><b>Chokhi Dhani</b></h2>
        <p>
            Around 20 kilometres from the main city of Jaipur, there is a mock village called ‘Chokhi Dhani’, which is a perfect mirror to the Rajasthani culture, food, traditions and heritage. The name Chokhi Dhani literally translates to Rajasthani Culture.
            Specially designed to attract and introduce tourists to the authentic Rajasthani culture and heritage, the village was set up in 1989 over an area spanning 10 acres. Soon after, by 1994, Chokhi Dhani gained its own share of fame among the tourists across the world.
