        <h2><b>Srinagar</b></h2>
        <p>
            Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu & Kashmir (J&K), is split into two by the river Jhelum. The star attraction here is the idyllic Dal Lake, having been ranked TripAdvisor’s top travellers’ choice for 2020. You can take a shikara ride in the daytime or a midnight cruise for a romantic evening. You will also spot Asia’s most extensive Tulip Garden and India’s only floating market here. The capital city of Srinagar is located 1585 meters above sea level. The city is famous for its gardens, lakes and houseboats. It is also known for traditional Kashmiri handicrafts and dried fruits. The city is located on both the sides of the Jhelum River, which is called Vyath in Kashmir.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Sonmarg</b></h2>
        <p>
            Literally meaning the ‘meadow of gold’, Sonmarg observes a widespread bloom of yellow crocuses during spring. Sonmarg or Sonamarg is a high-altitude tourist attraction in Srinagar’s northeast region. It is home to the famous three sisters – a group of rivers (the Lidder, Sind and the Neelum). It is also a popular base point for trekking excursions to the Thajiwas Glacier. While its surreal beauty will leave you stunned, a river rafting experience on the gushing Indus River will get your heart racing. Sonmarg is known to have a lot of significance in the old times. This is because it was the gateway of the Silk Road, which connected Kashmir and China. This is also a great base camp for Ladakh.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Gulmarg</b></h2>
        <p>
            Gulmarg, known as Gulmarag in Kashmiri, is a town, hill station, popular tourist destination, popular skiing destination and a notified area committee in the Baramulla district in the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is located at a distance of 31 km from Baramulla and 49 km from Srinagar. Gulmarg is a beautiful place in Kashmir that is an absolute delight for adventure seekers. This is the state’s crowning glory, offering the world’s second-highest gondola ride to Apharwat Peak (14,403 ft.) and the third-highest ski resort. Skiing, snowboarding, trekking and other activities will add more excitement to your holiday. For a culturally rich experience, visit this place during the three-day Winter Festival organised by the Indian Army and Tourism Ministry every year.
        </p>

        <h2><b>Pahalgam</b></h2>
        <p>
            Pahalgam is a hill station in the north Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. Mountain trails run northeast to Amarnath Cave Temple, a Hindu shrine and site of the annual Amarnath Yatra pilgrimage. Overa Aru Wildlife Sanctuary is home to animals including brown bears and musk deer. Northeast, the Lidder River runs through scenic Betaab Valley. Southeast, Tulian Lake is flanked by mountain peaks and often frozen. Pahalgam is a visual treat with its breath-taking vistas of lush greenery, vast Himalayan ranges and pristine mountain rivers. Stretched along the Lidder River, it is a popular spot for adventure junkies to try trout fishing, trekking and angling among others. It serves as the base camp for popular trekking getaways to Amarnath, etc.
        </p>
        
        <h2><b>Pulwama</b></h2>
        <p>
            Pulwama is a City and notified area council in the Pulwama district of the Indian-administered territory of Jammu and Kashmir. It is located approximately 25 kilometres south of the summer capital of Srinagar. Pulwama is a city that should be on everyone’s bucket list for multiple reasons. It is famous for its widespread saffron fields, largest milk production, and untouched surroundings. It is truly the ‘Delight of Kashmir’, as its blissful aura is unrivalled among Kashmir’s other attractions.
            It is a sought-after attraction where important religious sites and historical monuments can also be found. Do visit the Aharbal Waterfalls, Tarsar Lake, Shikargarh and Avantishwar Temple here.
        </p>
        <h2><b>Dachigam National Park</b></h2>
        <p>
            Dachigam National Park is a national park located, 22 kilometres from Srinagar city in Srinagar district of Jammu and Kashmir, India on the east side of Dal Lake. It covers an area of 161|62.16 by hgtian student SIJ. The Dachigam National Park is the world’s best-preserved natural habitat for the near-extinct Hangul or Kashmir stag (Red deer). It has piqued the interest of many wildlife enthusiasts to visit and photograph a wide range of species in their natural habitat. They believe that one visit is insufficient to explore its wilderness. The park is best known as the home of the hangul, or Kashmir stag. Dachigam is open throughout the year, but the best time to visit is between April and August.
        </p>
        <h2><b>Chandanwari</b></h2>
        <p>
            Chandanwari is the popular entry point to Amarnath, one of the four dhams of Hinduism. It is located exactly halfway between Srinagar and Amarnath. It is named after an interesting phenomenon in that it has a holy sandal (meaning ‘Chandan’) tree that is unlikely to survive at such high altitude and topography.

A trek to the Chandanwari Glacier point will give you unparalleled views of Pahalgam. Don’t skip the adrenaline-rushing sledge ride across a snow bridge and be mesmerised by this visual treat. Chandanwari is famous for being the base, or starting point, to the famous Hindu pilgrimage site, Shri Amarnath Yatra, which starts in June and ends in August. It is situated at an elevation of 2,895 meters, and located about 16 kilometers from Pahalgam.
