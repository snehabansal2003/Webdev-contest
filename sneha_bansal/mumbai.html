        <h2><b>Gateway of India</b></h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this 85 feet tall structure was to commemorate King George, the Fifth’s visit to Mumbai. Incidentally, the last of British soldiers that were to leave India after independence, departed through Gateway of India. The architecture is a perfect blend of three styles, namely Hindu, Islam and European Gothic styles. You could take ferry from here to visit Elephanta Caves. The Gateway of India is an arch monument built during the 20th century in Bombay, India. The monument was erected to commemorate the landing of King George V and Queen Mary at Apollo Bunder on their visit to India in 1911. The best time to visit Gateway of India is between October and March post monsoon
        </p>

        <h2><b>Elephanta Caves</b></h2>
        <p>
            Elephanta caves are in Elephanta Island, which is roughly around 40 minute ferry ride from Gateway of India. UNESCO has declared Elephanta Caves, belonging to 600 AD, as World Heritage Site. The stone sculptures of the Hindu and Buddhist gods are damaged because of the Portuguese who used them in their sword practice. Regardless, the artwork in the sculptures speak of the artistic excellence of the bygone era and no wonder, Elephanta Caves is considered one of the seven wonders of India. The Elephanta Caves are a collection of cave temples predominantly dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. They are on Elephanta Island, or Gharapuri, in Mumbai Harbour, 10 kilometres east of Mumbai in the Indian state of Mahārāshtra.

The stretch is ‘C’ shaped that links Nariman Point and Babulnath. The place offers spectacular view of sunset. Tourists are attracted to Marine Drive where they could stroll in the walkway and experience the cool breeze. 
            Marine Drive, also called the Queen's Necklace, is one of the most easily recognizable landmarks in Mumbai. This arc-shaped bay-side boulevard lining the Arabian Sea in South Mumbai is arguably the best spot to watch beautiful sunsets and indulge in leisurely walks.

Though it is a terminus to board and get off trains, you cannot help marveling at the stunning architecture of the building. Whether you intend to take a train or not, this is a must visit site in Mumbai. This is one of the finest functional Railway Station buildings of the world and is used by more than three million commuters daily. This property is an outstanding example of Victorian Gothic Architectural Revival in India, blended with the themes derived from Indian Traditional Architecture.

        <p>
            Located in the heart of Worli, Haji Ali Shrine reflects the Indian Muslim architecture. The 85 feet tall structure is located in 4500 meters area of land. The Shrine is constructed with marble that matches the marbles used in the construction of Taj Mahal. The pillars of the Shrine are artistic and the mirror work in the monument is stunning. The stupendous architecture of the Haji Ali Shrine attracts people of various religions and beliefs. Haji Ali Dargah is an iconic landmark in Mumbai, floating in the middle of sea like a revered mirage. This Indo-Islamic pilgrim site is a welcome yet striking sight located on an island near Worli coast in Mumbai.
